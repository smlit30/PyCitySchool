# MODULE 4 - PyCitySchools with Pandas

# OVERVIEW 

The purpose of this analysis was to remove the reading & math scores of the Thomas High School ninth grade class and run the analysis of school based on various metrics.  We first used numpy to remove all the grades for the reading scores and the math scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School.  Once all these scores were set to "NaN". We then went through the analysis again without these scores to see how Thomas High perforamce metrics ranked with the other schools.  

    The following sections will go over the district summary results and how the Thomas High School metrics changed without the results of the ninth grade class.  
        District Summary: The district summary as shown in comparison between figures 6-1 vs 6-2 has the same charter vs district perfomance was overall similar with removing the Thomas 9th grade class.  Thomas is a Charter school so it wouldn't change the district school performance even if the grades were drastically changed.  

        School Summary: Even with the removal of the ninth grade class the Thomas high school is still the second best performing school over all.  From the school performance summary we can tell that all the Charter schools are out performing their overall passing rate than any of the district schools.  

        Thomas High School Performance: Thomas High school perfrmance on math and reading was slightly changed by the removal of their 9th grade class but Thomas High is still a top performing school.  See below for further breakdown.  


        Affect of ninth grade scores on the following:
            Reading & Math Scores by Grade: See figures 2-1/3-1 and 3-1/3-2 for differences in reading & mathscores. 3-2 shows "nan" for new thomas high 9th grade class.
            Scores by school spending: Overall passing rates for the school spending results were not changed by a single 9th grade class beign removed.  The grades were not much different from the standard to change the results drastically.  See figures 4-1 vs 4-2 for more details
            Scores by School Size: Overall passing rates for the schoolsize amount were not changed by a single 9th grade class beign removed.  The grades were not much different from the standard to change the results drastically.  See figures 4-1 vs 4-2 for more details
            Scores by School Type: Overall passing is still far better for Charter schools vs District schools with or without the Thomas 9th grade class.  Average reading & math scores aren't that far behind the district however it appears to be the number of students in district schools who pass both math and reading is significantly lower than their charter counterparts.
